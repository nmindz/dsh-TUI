/**
 * Session-log compatibility helpers.
 *
 * Title lookup tolerates event types unknown to the current harness. Offline
 * rename and delete support the `/resume` picker when no live Agent owns the
 * selected persisted session. The resume seam registers vouched-for legacy
 * event types into every reachable KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES copy so the
 * strict read path stops rejecting whole sessions over them (issue #153).
 *
 * Registration background: plugins like dsh-working-activity (< the publish
 * cut) appended `activity/status` through `session.append`, but rc.6's
 * append exposes no `ignorable` flag and the type is absent from
 * KNOWN_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES — so resume's seed validation rejects the WHOLE
 * session ("unknown to this harness and not marked ignorable"). Upstream's
 * catalog header defers a registration surface "until such a consumer
 * exists"; the working-activity plugin became that consumer at #119 and
 * registers its type at load. Logs written BEFORE that cut, resumed in a
 * process where the plugin's registration never ran (plugin unmounted, or
 * a bare cordis.yml), still hit the rejection — this module is the consumer
 * for exactly that residue.
 *
 * Why registration and NOT rewriting the log to mark events `ignorable`
 * (the #107 approach, restored then replaced after review): the store is
 * shared with dsh web (#24) and possibly a second TUI instance (#153), and
 * a whole-file tmp+rename swap (a) loses frames an already-open appender
 * lands on the replaced inode, (b) drops the backend's 0600 artifact mode,
 * (c) re-encodes frames without the writer's checksum flag, and (d) dies on
 * torn tails the backend itself can recover. Registration touches nothing
 * on disk and degrades to exactly the pre-patch behavior when no copy
 * resolves.
 *
 * Whitelist discipline: ONLY `activity/status` — the type the plugin
 * provably wrote as ephemeral UI frames. Anything else unknown stays
 * unknown: upstream's fail-closed ("likely written by a newer harness") is
 * a feature — silently skipping a REQUIRED future event would reconstruct
 * a wrong session. Retires the day upstream's shared catalog adopts the
 * type or ships a real registration API (the add() calls become no-ops).
 *
 * The second half of this module is the bounded, tolerant, read-only log
 * reader behind the session tree (channel.buildSessionTree): 64 KiB chunked
 * I/O, lazy per-frame zstd decode over an RFC 8878 structural frame walk (a
 * torn final frame — crash mid-flush — is dropped as uncommitted, never
 * fatal), packed-row expansion, an event budget plus a scanned-envelope
 * budget so ignorable-heavy logs cannot multiply the cost of opening the
 * panel, and an inherited-prefix skip so a fork's event budget pays only for
 * its OWN events. It never writes; both stock encodings are read.

/**
 * Read a session's events from its persisted log — tolerant, read-only, and

 * must satisfy three constraints the strict backend read cannot:
 *
 *  - READ-ONLY: `persistence.inspect` rejects logs carrying third-party
 *    event types (working-activity's `activity/status`), and the resume
 *    seam's answer (in-process type registration, issue #153) must not be
 *    inverted here: opening a picker never rewrites a history log. This
 *    reader never writes; unknown types are simply passed through
 *    (extractEntries skips what it does not know).
 *  - TOLERANT: envelope-shape or decode anomalies degrade to
 *    `failed: true` (a structure-only tree node) instead of rejecting the
 *    whole log — and a torn FINAL zstd frame (crash mid-flush) is dropped
 *    as uncommitted, keeping the frames before it readable.
 *  - BOUNDED: the file is read in 64 KiB slices and frames decode lazily,
 *    stopping the moment `maxEvents` events have been collected — a
 *    200k-event log costs budget × per-event work, not a whole-file read +
 *    decompress + parse. `complete: false` marks the early stop (the caller
 *    surfaces it as `truncated`). One honest exception: a single zstd FRAME
 *    is the atomic unit (see logRecords) — the budget bounds work ACROSS
 *    frames, never inside one giant flush.
 *
 * Packed rows are expanded with the backend's own `decodeStorageRecord`:
 * the packChunks writer folds each run of same-block delta chunks into ONE
 * `text-chunks`/`reasoning-chunks`/`tool-call-chunks` line (the default —
 * the finding that motivated this reader's third revision), so a line is a
 * storage record, not an event, and seq-less rows must not be dropped as if
 * they were headers. The budget counts EXPANDED events, matching the tree's
 * per-event cost. Malformed packed rows throw inside decodeStorageRecord —
 * corrupt storage degrades to `undefined`, never to silently dropped runs.
 *
 * Torn-tail semantics mirror the backend's own reader: a plain log's
 * unterminated final line (crash mid-append) is uncommitted data and
 * ignored, while an unterminated record INSIDE a complete zstd frame is
 * corruption and fails the read.
 *
 * Envelopes with `ignorable: true` are skipped (the read path's own skip
 * signal) and the seq-less header row is metadata, not an event. Skipped
 * envelopes still count against the SCAN budget (maxScanned): skipping is
 * not free — the I/O, decompress and JSON.parse for them have already been
 * paid — so an ignorable-heavy log cannot bypass the cost bound by keeping
 * its collectible count low. Never throws; returns undefined ONLY when the
 * log is absent — an existing-but-undecodable log returns `failed: true`
 * so the caller degrades to a placeholder instead of escalating to an
 * unbounded strict re-read.
 * @param sessionId - Session whose log should be read.

 *   collected (branch-head labels need them; they never become entries).
