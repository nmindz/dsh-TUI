/**
 * Built-in subscription OAuth sign-in as LLM provider routes.
 *
 * One internal Cordis module mounts supported subscription routes from the
 * installed pi-ai catalog (ChatGPT/Codex, Claude, Grok, and newer flows when
 * available) as `llm` registry routes. A route is claimed only while its
 * provider is signed in, so its models appear in model pickers. When the
 * Host supplies `deepseekAccount`, the same sign-in surface also delegates
 * DeepSeek browser authorization to that service; the Host owns its model
 * route, callback, and credential store.
 * `PiAiAdapter` runs with this
 * module's file-backed pi-ai `CredentialStore` injected
 * (`PiAiAuthInjection`): requests resolve the stored OAuth credential through
 * the provider's own auth and rotate refresh tokens under the store's lock.
 * Login/logout run over the `userQuestions` seam, so they work on any
 * interactive surface and refuse cleanly where none exists (TUI-RUN-001).
 *
 * ```yaml
 * - id: dsh-tui-auth
 *   name: '@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/oauth'
 *   inject: [llm, commands]
 *   config:
 *     # providers: [openai-codex, anthropic, xai]  # optional catalog subset;
 *     # newer pi-ai also offers openai and meta
 *     # credentialsFile: /secure/path/credentials.json   # default $DSH_HOME/dsh-auth/
 *     # Per-provider catalog overrides, keyed by provider id then model id:
 *     # any optional field keeps the installed catalog's value. The example
 *     # below tunes the Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` context window to 1M tokens.
 *     # modelOverrides:
 *     #   openai-codex:
 *     #     gpt-5.6-sol:
 *     #       contextWindow: 1000000
 * ```
 *
 * Routes register individually, and only while signed in: a provider route id
 * belongs to whoever can serve it, so a signed-out route is left for another
 * adapter family (an llm-pi-ai settings profile naming the same provider) to
 * claim. Login registers the route, logout gives it back. A route the other
 * family already owns is refused by the registry — that refusal is logged and
 * the remaining routes still mount.
 *
 * @module @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/oauth
