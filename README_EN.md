# dsh-TUI

`dsh-TUI` is an interactive terminal UI for DeepSeek Harness. It is mounted as
a Cordis plugin and provides conversation, tool, session, and fullscreen
terminal views while continuing to use the
official DSH agent, model, tool, session, and persistence services.

The project does not patch DeepSeek Harness core. Installing the plugin enables
the interface, and removing it leaves no core modifications behind.

> Status: public beta. It is suitable for daily use and extension work. Read
> [Architecture and limitations](docs/architecture.en.md) before relying on its
> permission model or terminal-specific behavior.

## Highlights

- **Terminal-native interaction**: streaming Markdown, structured tool cards
  (terminal-card multi-line command headers fold to the first line plus a
  count via `/settings`; Ctrl+O or a card click expands), command and file completion, `@` file references (complete anywhere; text
  files attach content, directories attach listings, and PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF are
  sent as durable image blocks; `@path#L12-14` line ranges attach only the
  requested lines, clamping past-EOF ranges or falling back to the whole file
  with a note), history
  search, message selection, inline or alternate-screen rendering, and `/lang`
  zh/en UI language switching. Durable image blocks from user attachments and
  assistant/tool output render as in-transcript previews through Kitty graphics or Sixel,
  with a same-size text fallback when graphics are unavailable. In fullscreen,
  clicking a staged `[Image #N]` token or a transcript thumbnail opens one
  shared preview centered over the transcript, dimming the conversation around
  it and leaving the prompt visible (Esc or click outside closes); its title reads `Image #N — format · size · bytes ·
  file name` and images staged in this session show their source path on the
  card's bottom row. Finder-copied
  image files paste straight into the attachment store as `[Image #N]`; in the
  composer a staged `[Image #N]` is one unit — the caret steps over it, deletes
  remove it whole, and while the caret sits on it the token inverts and its
  preview opens, closing again when the caret leaves. Vim `x`/`X`/`d…` also
  delete whole attachments, and `u` restores both text and attachment bindings;
  undo stays within the current draft.
  Terminal image previews default to on. Disable them in `/settings → Terminal image previews`
  or set `terminalImages: false`, then use `/restart` to apply. A saved `/settings` choice takes
  precedence over Cordis configuration; if it was saved as enabled, turn it off in `/settings`
  before restarting. Disabled previews keep text
  metadata and skip preview decoding; sending images to the model is unaffected.
  `DSH_TUI_DISABLE_TERMINAL_IMAGES=1` always forces previews off.
  Windows Terminal with Sixel support displays embedded transcript thumbnails
  and the fullscreen preview card. Non-fullscreen inline mode stays text-only.
  Sixel uses a bounded 256-color adaptive palette and background-composited
  transparency. A worker caches quantized pixels and encodes only the visible
  crop while scrolling; removed or covered images are erased. Attachment reads
  and decodes share two execution slots and cancel when their last consumer leaves.
  Queues, caches and frame transfers are bounded, with text fallback on overflow.
  Detection prefers Kitty, then Sixel advertised by DA1.
  `DSH_TUI_IMAGE_PROTOCOL=auto|kitty|sixel|none` overrides protocol selection;
  `DSH_TUI_DISABLE_TERMINAL_IMAGES=1`, accessibility mode, non-TTY output and
  tmux/screen still disable graphics. Missing image dependencies or an encoding
  failure preserve the text fallback. The override does not enable inline Sixel.
  Light-theme panels and image previews use white surfaces with neutral preview borders.
  Large previews target about 95% of the transcript area, with up to a 2048-pixel edge
  and a bounded total pixel budget; thumbnail sizing is unchanged.
  Fit, actual pixels (100%), and 200%/400%/800% zoom are available, with drag,
  wheel, or arrow-button panning. Actual pixels requires reported terminal cell metrics.
  The bottom Open original link launches the system image viewer with the unchanged
  attachment bytes, including images restored from history.
  In a modal, Left/Right or the bottom ‹/› controls switch images with an index
  indicator, without wrapping at the ends. Each new image starts in Fit mode.
- **Pixel whale pet**: one of three randomized startup intros plays on every
  launch. During the welcome phase (before the first task), **clicking the
  whale pops a heart pass and wakes it from a doze**, it flutters its fins
  and thumps its tail while
  idle (`/settings → whaleIdle` turns this off), and dozes off with Z's
  after 10s of inactivity. **The first agent task freezes it to the static
  standard frame for good** — zero ongoing cost. The 22
  hand-drawn frames and the idle behaviors are ported from
  [dsh-ui-whale](https://github.com/lhh010/dsh-ui-whale) by [@lhh010](https://github.com/lhh010).
- **Timeline navigation**: a Grok-style turn rail covering **every turn
  (folded ones included)** — even when the fold window only exposes the last
  few turns, the full history stays one click away (clicking a folded tick
  reveals that turn and scrolls to it). When not pinned to the bottom,
  `Enter`/`End` jump back in one step (no blank flash from long distances)
  and a clickable new-messages pill stays in view; the right gutter offers
  timeline / scrollbar / hidden modes.
- **Visible agent state**: live activity, segmented context usage, TPS, cache
  hit rate, reasoning effort, input/output tokens, and Git/session metadata.
  In fullscreen, hovering a truncated tool header, wrapped user prompt, or
  session title for ~600ms opens a tooltip with the full content.
- **Activity animation**: `moon8` is the default. A legacy local `claude`
  setting is read as `moon8`, and the picker lists current presets only.
- **Complete session workflow**: `/resume` groups history by working directory
  with search and preview (left-click resumes, right-click opens an action
  menu; pin frequent sessions — a `Pinned` group floats them to the top, the
  in-row star or `Ctrl+P` toggles, pins persist in `~/.dsh-tui`), alongside
  `/new`, `/workspace`, `/compact`, `/export`,
  the `/btw` side question, model switching, double-`Esc` rewind through a
  session fork, vim editing for the prompt (`/vim`), mouse selection
  editing in the prompt (drag to select, Shift+click to extend,
  double-click word select, `Ctrl+C` to copy the selection), and a
  fullscreen draft editor (`Ctrl+Shift+E` or the `⛶` row button: line
  numbers, current-line highlight, `Enter` = newline, `Ctrl+Enter` = send,
  wheel scrolling, click/drag selection — long drafts get the whole
  screen; disable it in `/settings`).
- **Official DSH integrations**: agent presets, skills, MCP, goals, todos,
  subagents, and `ask_user_question` are connected through existing services
  and registries. `/skills` shows skills discovered from the active profile,
  user, and project; dsh-TUI does not preinstall general-purpose skills.
- **Designed for long sessions**: event-driven projection, differential output,
  message virtualization, replay coalescing, and bounded caches prevent render
  cost and memory from growing without limit; fingerprint-memoized hot paths
  render with **zero per-frame allocations** (~200KB of GC churn saved every
  16ms tick in a 3200-row session), wrapText and markdown tokens reuse global
  LRU caches across mounts, the main screen paints in frames (fold window
  300→120 rows), and long-session resume lands straight on content (splash
  skipped, anchored to the newest message's last row).

## Preview

Live activity, goal/todo state, and context metrics:

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: an interactive terminal TTY, the official `dsh` CLI, and
`pnpm` 10+. Model requests also require `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

```sh
# 1. Install the CLI and this plugin globally (ships the dsh-tui command)
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui

# 2. Start it (first run auto-initializes the dsh-tui profile; needs pnpm)
dsh-tui
# Both `dsh-tui` and the short `dst` alias start the same TUI.
dst
```

Manual alternative: `dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`
(the repository's `sh install.sh` wraps this step and checks the required
commands), then `dsh-tui` (or `dst`) and `dsh --profile dsh-tui` are equivalent.

> **New-user note**: if `dsh plugin` fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`
> (pnpm ≥11 blocks dependencies that carry install scripts by default, e.g.
> `@google/genai` and `protobufjs` — none of these scripts is needed at
> runtime, so they can safely be ignored), add to the profile's
> `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:
>
> ```yaml
> allowBuilds:
>   '@google/genai': false
>   protobufjs: false
> ```
>
> `/update` and `dsh-tui update` seed this configuration automatically —
> no manual step needed.

`dsh-tui` (or its `dst` alias) with `--resume` restores the most recently selected session; on Windows
the repository's `dsh-tui.cmd` works the same way.

CLI subcommands (`dsh-tui help` or `dst help` prints the full usage; the `dst` alias accepts the same commands):

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dsh-tui update` | Update the profile to the latest release and align the launcher (same install logic as the in-TUI `/update`, without restarting into the TUI) |
| `dsh-tui doctor` | Pre-flight environment checks: dsh/pnpm, profile install and version alignment, whether the API key is set (state only, never the value), config file presence; complements the in-TUI `/doctor` session diagnostics |
| `dsh-tui version` | Show the launcher and profile versions (`--version`/`-v` are equivalent) |
| `dsh-tui help` | Show usage (`--help`/`-h` are equivalent) |

`help`/`version` work even when dsh is missing or the profile is not initialized; `update` needs dsh (a missing dsh gets an install hint);
every other argument is still forwarded verbatim to `dsh --profile dsh-tui`.
The repository-root `dsh-tui.cmd` is a launch wrapper that goes straight to
`dsh --profile` and carries no subcommands — subcommands belong to the
npm-installed `dsh-tui` command.

### Herdr

Run `dsh-tui` directly in a [Herdr](https://herdr.dev) pane; no extra setup is
required. dsh-TUI reports `idle`, `working`, and `blocked` through Herdr's local
integration API and marks questionnaires and tool approvals as `blocked`. The
integration is completely inactive outside Herdr. `herdr agent start --kind
dsh-tui`, session identity, and automatic restoration after a Herdr server
restart still require a native dsh-TUI agent kind upstream; manually launched
panes already retain, reconnect, and expose their live state.

For running dsh-TUI inside VS Code — directly in the integrated terminal or
via the `dsh-tui-vscode` companion extension (real-integrated-terminal
sessions, and specific-session resume; the extension is available on the VS Code
Marketplace) — see
[Running dsh-TUI in VS Code](docs/vscode.en.md).

See [Getting started](docs/getting-started.en.md) for profile composition,
source builds, and troubleshooting.

The TUI checks the configured registry for newer versions in the background
after startup (the check never blocks the first frame and silently ignores
offline or registry errors). When an update is available, just type `/update`
for a one-shot upgrade: it updates the runtime actually running in the current
`dsh-tui` profile, verifies the install result, then restarts automatically and
resumes the current session.

When launched through the global `dsh-tui` command, newer versions
automatically migrate/align the global entry to a delegating launcher: the
global command only forwards to the copy inside the profile, so the startup
logic always follows the profile version.

Under normal circumstances no extra manual step is needed:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui
```

For migration from the former `dsh-cc-tui` package and `cc-tui` profile, see
[Getting started](docs/getting-started.en.md#migrate-from-the-former-package).

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Idle = send (`Shift+Enter` for a newline, or `Ctrl+J` when the terminal cannot report modified Enter; `Option+Enter` is the fallback on macOS Terminal.app, issue #110); **while the model is working = steer** (inject a next-step boundary without interrupting); executes the selected item when a command menu is open |
| `Ctrl+Enter` (⌘Enter) | **Interrupt the current turn and send immediately** (interrupt) |
| `Alt+Up` | Pull the last unhandled message back into the input for editing (without interrupting the turn) |
| `Tab` | Complete `/` commands or `@` files (keep drilling into directories); **while the model is working = follow-up** (queued after the current turn) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt the current turn; press again while the interrupt is still settling to force-exit; press twice while idle to exit; **with an active mouse selection in the prompt, copies it to the clipboard and keeps it** |
| `Esc` | Close an open image preview; close the command/file menu; **with an active selection in the prompt: only clears the selection**; double-press while idle clears the input; **double-press on empty input = time rewind** |
| `←` (empty input) | **Background this session and open the agent view** (with text, ← moves the caret as usual) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Expand/collapse details (full thinking text, tool arguments and output) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+E` | Expand the fullscreen draft editor (Enter = newline, `Ctrl+Enter` = send, `Esc` = collapse keeping the draft; line numbers, wheel scrolling, click/drag selection) |
| `Ctrl+R` | History search |
| `/` | In-session full-text search (`n`/`N` to jump) |
| `Ctrl+V` / `Alt+V` | Paste text or files from the file manager; images show as `[Image #N]` and are sent as durable attachments. Use `Alt+V` when the terminal intercepts `Ctrl+V` |
| `Ctrl+G` | Edit the current input with `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR` (e.g. nvim); content is filled back in on save and exit |
| `/vim` | Toggle vim editing for the prompt (session-scoped): `Esc` switches to NORMAL (`h/l/j/k`, `0/^/$`, `w/b`, `x/X`, `dd`/`d$`/`d0`/`dw`, `u` undo), `i/a/o` back to INSERT |
| `?` | Keybinding menu (responds only when the input is empty) |
| `Shift+↑` | Message selection mode (`Enter` expands a single message) |
| `Ctrl+P` | Toggle the startup loaded-context panel while it is on screen; inside `/resume`, pin/unpin the selected session |
| `Home` / `End`, `Ctrl+A` / `Ctrl+E` | `Ctrl+A` opens the subagent dashboard (in-editor `Mod+A` still moves to line start); `Ctrl+E` is dual-purpose: line end in the input, expand/collapse hidden older messages during transcription |
| `Ctrl+←` / `Ctrl+→` (⌘←/→) | Jump by word |
| `←` / `→` (image modal) | Previous / next image; caret peeks retain prompt editing |
| `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+K` | Delete before the cursor (to line start) / after the cursor (to line end) |
| `Ctrl+W` | Delete the previous word |

**Three delivery modes while the model is working**: `Enter` = steer (inject a next-step boundary, no interruption) · `Tab` = follow-up (queued after the current turn) · `Ctrl+Enter` = interrupt (break in and send immediately).

**Custom keybindings**: the action shortcuts above (paste, history search, external editor, transcript expand, trajectory, subagent dashboard, loaded-context panel, show-all, redraw, todo fold) are remappable in `/settings` → `dsh-tui` → `Shortcuts`: enter combos like `alt+v` or `ctrl+shift+v`, comma-separate several, leave blank to restore the default; saves apply live with no restart. Combos that clash with the fixed editing keys (`Ctrl+A/E/U/K/W`, `Ctrl+←/→`) or with another action are rejected. Deployments can also pin them statically via `shortcuts.<action>` in cordis.yml (the settings user layer wins).

**macOS modifier keys**: the `Ctrl+<key>` bindings above also work with `⌘<key>`
on macOS (e.g. `⌘V` paste, `⌘O` expand details, `⌘Enter` send immediately);
only `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+D` (interrupt/exit) stay on Ctrl, to avoid clashing
with muscle memory for macOS system-level `⌘C` copy and similar. `⌘` requires
terminal support for the extended keyboard protocol (iTerm2 / kitty / WezTerm /
ghostty / tmux); macOS's built-in Terminal.app consumes `⌘` shortcuts itself,
so keep using `Ctrl`.

**Mouse** (fullscreen is the factory default since 0.9.0; set `fullscreen: false` to restore the inline main screen; updating from an older version clears a previously saved inline choice once — you can still pick inline again afterwards)

| Action | Function |
|---|---|
| Drag to select | In-app text selection, **copied on release** (OSC 52 with native `wl-copy`/`xclip`/`xsel` fallback; `load-buffer -w` inside tmux); the selection is cleared after copying and a "Copied N characters" notice pops up |
| Double / triple click | Select word / line, copied on selection just the same |
| Drag inside the prompt input | Build an in-input selection (rendered highlight): `Backspace`/`Delete` delete it, typing replaces it, `←/→` collapse it to the corresponding edge, `Esc` only clears it; a folded paste block keeps the selection on the clicked side |
| `Shift+click` in the prompt input | Extend the selection from its start edge (or the caret) to the clicked position |
| Double-click a word in the prompt input | Select the whole word (paths and punctuation runs select as one; detected in the component, 500 ms / 1 cell) |
| `Ctrl+C` with a prompt selection | Copy the selection to the clipboard (OSC 52 + native fallback) and keep it for editing |
| Scroll wheel | Only with fullscreen mouse tracking: scroll Help while it is open, otherwise scroll messages (±3 lines per notch); default inline mode does not deliver wheel events to the TUI |
| Click a timeline-rail tick | Jump to that turn — the rail covers every turn (folded ones included); a folded tick reveals its turn first, then scrolls it into place |
| `Esc` | Cancel an in-progress drag selection (no copy) |
| Single-click a message line | Expand/collapse that line |
| Click a staged `[Image #N]` token / a transcript thumbnail | Open the centered image preview (metadata fallback without Kitty/Sixel graphics); click outside the preview to close it |
| Click "load earlier messages" / "ctrl+e show previous N" | Load earlier messages / expand all |
| Click the StickyHeader / "↓ N new messages" | Jump back to the pinned message / scroll to the bottom |
| Click a hyperlink | Open it in your browser |
| Keyboard selection extension | With a selection active, `Shift+←/→/↑/↓/Home/End` extends or shrinks it (wrapping across lines) |

**Questionnaires** (when the model fires `ask_user_question`)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑/↓` | Choose an option |
| `Space` | Toggle multi-select options |
| `Tab` | Switch to a custom answer (type directly without picking an option) |
| `Enter` | Submit the current selection |
| `Esc` (from question 2 onward) | Return to the previous question and keep the current draft |
| `Esc` (from question 1) / `Ctrl+C` | Cancel the whole question batch (the model receives ASK_CANCELLED and can continue the conversation) |

**Built-in commands** (routed through the official DSH pipeline)

| Group | Commands |
|---|---|
| Session | `/new` new session · `/resume` working-directory/session browser (visible directory scope, search, preview, cross-project, sub-agent runs folded) · `/agentview` agent view (all sessions) · `/bg` (alias `/background`) background this session and open the view · `/rename` rename session · `/recap` session recap (apply the suggested title in one key; `/settings` can enable an auto-summary on session open — on by default: a divider + `Recap:` line appears at the bottom of the transcript when resuming, and bows out once you send a new message) · `/workspace resume\|rename\|open` manage workspaces · `/clear` clear screen · `/compact` compact · `/export` export Markdown · `/trace` trace timeline (or `Ctrl+T`) · `/rewind` rewind picker (same as double-`Esc` on empty input) · `/tree` session family tree (every fork branch stitched together; hover previews a node, click opens a rewind/fork-here/adopt-branch menu) · `/fork` copy the current session into a resumable twin (the original is untouched) · `/btw <question>` side question (never interrupts the main turn, writes no history) |
| Status | `/context` loaded-context details · `/status` session info · `/cost` token usage · `/doctor` environment self-check · `/config` configuration sources · `/init` create AGENTS.md · `/settings` settings panel (namespace read/edit) |
| Model | `/model` two-level picker (a pinned **Recently used** group first — the last 10 switched models, persisted at `~/.dsh-tui/model-recents.json` — then provider groups — every route the llm registry holds, including ones whose catalog is empty, which read as unavailable instead of disappearing; Enter drills into a group's models; a single provider with no recents skips straight to the list; **switching = fork continuation, history preserved**) · `/effort` reasoning effort (slider / `status` / `<id>`; the default level new sessions start on is set in `/settings` → Default reasoning effort) · `/preset` agent preset (**cannot switch once the session has started** — blank-only) · `/thinking` thinking display · `/tokens` token details · `/activity` working animation (`frames <name>` / `status`) · `/theme` theme picker · `/color` (bare opens the palette picker; `<name>` sets directly; `status`/`reset`) session accent color (input border + session-name chip at the top-right, per-session; chip off by default, enable in `/settings`) · `/lang` zh/en UI switch (also selectable in `/settings`) |
| Accounts/Policy | `/provider` manage model providers — add a provider, or edit an existing one via a menu (API key · model list · delete the provider; custom endpoints also get base URL · wire protocol; a targeted edit patches only that field, the rest of the profile survives untouched; the model list pre-checks what you already enabled; only user-layer providers are editable) (includes the bundled dsh-auth **subscription OAuth sign-in** branch — ChatGPT / Claude / Grok, no API key; same source as `/auth status\|login\|logout`) · `/login` credential & account status · `/logout` logout notes · `/permission` dynamic preset/status notes · `/add-dir` file-policy scope · `/hooks` · `/mcp` |
| Skills | `/skills` lists skills discovered by DSH; user-invocable skills join the `/` menu as `/name` |
| Other | `/agents` subagent list · `/plugins check <path>` plugin diagnostics · `/update` auto-update and restart · `/vim` vim editing mode toggle · `/terminal-setup` · `/connect` · `/help` · `/exit` (aliases `/quit` `/q`) |
| Registry | `/plan` `/goal` `/feedback` `/permission` (DSH command-registry plugins, merged into the `/` menu automatically with the plugin) |

> Unknown commands are sent to the model as ordinary messages (e.g. in a composition where `/permission` is not mounted).

**Agent view** (`/agentview`)

One full-screen surface lists every session in this process: the attached conversation, background sessions dispatched here, and stopped TUI sessions persisted on disk. The header shows `model · directory` and state counts (awaiting input · working · completed); rows are grouped by state (needs input > working > failed > completed > idle > stopped), and working rows animate their glyph. Each row includes a one-line activity summary derived from the session's own output (no extra model calls); a row waiting on input shows the question it is blocked on. **Only sessions this TUI dispatched, backgrounded, or attached to from the view are listed** — the ordinary `/resume` history and sessions created by other front doors (e.g. web) never appear.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑/↓`, `PgUp/PgDn` | Move between rows |
| `Enter` / `→` | Attach to the selected session (with input text: dispatch it) |
| `Shift+Enter` | Dispatch and attach immediately |
| `Space` | Toggle the peek panel (when the input is empty); type a reply inside and `Enter` to send |
| `Ctrl+X` | Stop a background session; press again within 2s to delete it (log removed) |
| `Ctrl+R` | Rename the selected session |
| `Esc` | Close peek → clear input → exit; **when opened via ← `/bg`, the final Esc returns to the backgrounded session** |
| `Ctrl+C` | Clear input; press again to exit |
| `?` | Show all shortcuts |

- Type a task in the input at the bottom and press `Enter` to dispatch a **background session**: it runs independently inside this process (turns, tools, approvals all work) without you watching it.
- **Press `←` on an empty prompt** to jump straight into the view: the attached session moves to the background — it keeps running — the terminal lands on a fresh session, and the view opens (same as `/bg`), with a "Your conversation moved to the background — Enter opens it · Esc returns to it · Ctrl+C twice quits" notice on top. The prompt footer keeps a live "← N agents" count whenever background sessions are waiting on you.
- A background session that needs approval shows as **needs input**; the approval panel pops up right inside the view and is answered there (labelled with its session).
- `/bg` (alias `/background`) moves the attached session to the background — it keeps running — switches the terminal to a fresh session, and opens the view. `Enter` on any row switches back.
- Peek and reply work live for running sessions; a stopped session needs an `Enter` attach before you can talk to it.
- **Background sessions live inside this process**: they stop when the TUI exits (logs survive; `/resume` or `Enter` in the view brings them back). There is no supervisor process.

## Configuration & Extensions

- **Agent presets**: four official agent modes (`standard` / `ptc` / `minimal` / `cordis`)
  plus the TUI-bundled Liangshen mode (`liangshen`),
  switched with `/preset`; sessions that already have a conversation cannot switch, while
  blank sessions take effect immediately. The default preset persists in
  `~/.dsh-tui/agent-preset.json`; `/model` selections persist in `~/.dsh-tui/model.json`.
  Under the `en` UI language the `/preset` picker shows localized English names
  and descriptions for the built-in presets.
  See [Configuration](docs/configuration.en.md#agent-preset).
- **Themes**: the `/theme` picker (`auto` follows the system/terminal background,
  built-in `light` / `dark` / `dark-ansi`) accepts static themes from
  `~/.dsh-tui/themes/<name>.json` and runtime themes registered by npm plugins through
  `ctx.tuiThemes` — selecting one hot-swaps and persists it; precedence is
  `DSH_TUI_THEME` env var > persisted selection > OSC 11 terminal-background auto-detection.
  See [Themes](docs/themes.en.md).
- **MCP**: servers are mounted via `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`, with tools registered as
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; `/mcp` shows connection status.
  See [Configuration](docs/configuration.en.md#mcp).

## How It Works

```text
dsh profile
  -> dsh-base
  -> dsh-TUI Cordis patch
  -> agent preset + DSH services
  -> session/event
  -> Channel projection
  -> React components
  -> Ink/Yoga renderer
  -> terminal
```

The TUI owns interaction and presentation only. The session log remains the
conversation source of truth, while model calls, tool execution, fork/resume,
compaction, and persistence remain owned by DSH services. See the
[architecture guide](docs/architecture.en.md) for module boundaries and
performance details.

```text
chat / tool base events ──> persisted Session log ──> TUI / Web
          └───────────────> ActivityTracker (memory) ──> TUI status only
```

## Technical Notes

- **Gentle Mist Blue palette**: mist blue carries only branding, focus, interaction,
  and highlights; body text stays neutral gray. On startup the terminal background
  color (OSC 11) is queried to auto-select a light or dark palette, falling back to
  dark when the terminal does not respond.
- **Event-driven rendering**: the `session/event` stream drives incremental differential
  rendering; scroll state is maintained independently.
- **Layout-level virtualization**: per-frame cost for long sessions drops from
  O(entire session) to O(visible window) — off-screen message lines render as
  height-only placeholders whose subtrees never take part in layout.
- **Zero-allocation hot paths**: the visibleRows pipeline (slice/filter/margins)
  is memoized on rows identity, length, and a Uint8Array streaming-bit
  fingerprint — zero array/Map allocations per scroll tick, while in-place
  settle writes still rebuild the cache instantly (empty-row filtering never
  lags); wrapText and markdown tokens flow through global LRU caches that
  reuse measurements across mounts.
- **Framed backfill and landing anchor**: opening the main screen mounts the
  tail window first and backfills history in frames; `/resume` asserts a final
  state where the newest message's last row is visible and reachable, and
  long-session restores skip the splash animation to land straight on content.
- **Context progress bar**: based on the pi-nano-context algorithm (largest-remainder
  segmented coloring + multi-level condensed readouts).
- **TPS meter**: based on pi-tps-meter — a streaming 1/8-block gauge, historical
  min-max sparkline, and speed-based semantic colors (≥50 green / ≥20 yellow / <20 red).
- **working-activity ecosystem**: the working-status line reuses the pure state machine of
  [dsh-working-activity](https://github.com/ccch1mneyyy/working-activity),
  deriving it in-process from base session events without writing UI state into the shared log.
- **Terminal paste**: in raw mode `Ctrl+V` is handled by the app and reads the system
  clipboard per platform — PowerShell `Get-Clipboard` on Windows, `osascript`/`pbpaste`
  on macOS, and auto-detected `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel` on Linux; regular non-image
  files insert their path, while copied image files and clipboard bitmaps are written
  to the attachment library and shown in the input as `[Image #N]`; plain text is
  inserted at the cursor.

## Known Limitations

- Injected context (plugin source content) has no standalone display and is merged
  into the progress-bar statistics along with the system prompt.
- `/model` live switching works via "session fork continuation" (DSH has no in-place
  model-switch API): history is preserved as-is, the new session routes to the new
  model, and the old session stays in the `/resume` list; the choice is written to
  `~/.dsh-tui/model.json` and survives both restart and `/new`.
- `Ctrl+V` clipboard reads depend on external tools per platform: PowerShell
  `Get-Clipboard` on Windows (auto-retries when the clipboard is briefly locked by
  another process, silently gives up when persistently locked); `osascript`/`pbpaste`
  on macOS (multi-file copies in Finder have no stable AppleScript read path, falling
  back to text/images); Linux needs one of `wl-paste`/`xclip`/`xsel` and a connectable
  session (a missing tool or unreachable session shows a "no clipboard tool available"
  notice). Unsupported clipboard-bitmap formats are rejected with a warning and
  their private temporary export is deleted; an unavailable attachment service
  likewise leaves the bitmap out of the draft. Copied image files can still fall
  back to an `@` reference when direct staging fails.
- Exit finishes with a process exit and does not wait for the agent's async disk writes
  (persistence is covered by the persistence plugin as a backstop).
- **Agent view background sessions live inside this process**: they all stop when the
  TUI exits (a supervisor process and survival across restarts are out of v1 scope);
  row summaries come from the session's own output with no extra summary-model calls;
  worktree isolation, pinning, directory grouping, and shell background jobs are not
  shipped yet.
- Tool-level approval is implemented: the approval service + TUI answerer (local
  approval panel) consumes the approval stream, and privilege-escalation commands pop
  an approval bar. `/permission` preset switching comes from dsh-base's
  `permission-presets` plugin and is available in the profile composition by default.
  If that registry service is absent, TUI uses its legacy three-row compatibility
  roster; a malformed mounted service is unavailable and fails closed. If the
  external `/permission` command is not registered, input keeps the existing
  default/model dispatch behavior.
- `/connect` `/hooks` are reserved placeholders: the corresponding
  capabilities have no equivalent mechanism on the DSH side, and the commands give an
  explicit explanation rather than staying silent.
- The `/thinking` display toggle is **not persisted**; restarts and new sessions fall
  back to the default.
- `/compact` is unavailable under the `minimal` preset (that preset does not compose
  compaction).
- `/update` works only when started via `dsh --profile` and is refused while a turn is
  running.

See [Architecture and limitations](docs/architecture.en.md) for the complete list of
known limitations and the security boundary.

## Development

CI uses Node 24 and pnpm 11. The package supports Node `^22.19 || >=24`.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm smoke
```

`lib/types/` is ignored generated output. `pnpm build` recompiles it from a
clean output directory and runs the build gates. **Git URL installs are not supported** (the source manifest keeps
`@dsh-std/*` as workspace deps, `vendor/dsh-std` is a submodule, and pnpm ≥11 refuses
git-hosted `prepare` scripts by default); install the registry package:
`dsh plugin --profile dsh-tui add @deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui`. Rendering, questionnaire, or tool-card
changes also require the relevant regression scripts.

- **Organization**: [dsh-tui-ecosystem](https://github.com/dsh-tui-ecosystem)
  (home of community plugins and templates)
- **Template repository**: [plugin-template](https://github.com/dsh-tui-ecosystem/plugin-template)
  (start from the template and ship a plugin in minutes)
- **Reference implementation**: `dsh-working-activity` (live working-status
  line with dual outlets: TUI prompt slot + `activity/status` session events)

### Seam stability reference

An **informal** maturity grading to help plugin authors gauge investment;
the authoritative status and compatibility agreement live in the
[admission & development guide](https://github.com/T-Auto/dsh-ecosystem-spec/blob/main/docs/plugin-admission-and-development.md):

| Tier | Seams |
| --- | --- |
| Stable candidate (shape frozen; breaking changes go through a minor-version deprecation warning before removal) | VI settings sections · VIII full-screen scenes · X managed dialogs · XI status line · XII keyboard shortcuts · XIII entry renderers |
| Experimental (may still shift with dsh-std / admission-spec evolution) | IX decision events · toast notifications (`ctx.tuiToast`, new) |
| Upstream-tracked (stability owned by the cordis / dsh mechanisms underneath) | I session events · II official prompt slots · III bundled skills · IV themes · V system-prompt sections · VII profile composition |

Also experimental public surface: `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/api`
(types-only entry). The `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/test-utils` subpath has
been removed — it exposed helpers that could inject a real activationId and is
not suitable as a production public API. For headless tests, copy the approach
from `scripts/lib/plugin-test-utils.ts` in this repository and run through the
normal admission flow in your own test environment.

Public API migration notes:
- **`ctx.tuiPluginHost.grants.corrupt` no longer exists.** The new caller-safe
  `HostGrantFacade` exposes only `allows(pluginCtx, permission, scope)`,
  `defaultOf`, `knownPermissions`, and `onChange(pluginCtx, listener)`; a
  corrupt grants file is no longer surfaced as a boolean field on the
  plugin-facing object. `onChange` is a subscribe-class mediated capability:
  it requires the calling activation, is shadow-guarded, and its returned
  cancellation is bound to that activation so the file poller/listener cannot
  leak on unload. Use `ctx.tuiPluginHost.selfCheck()`, `/doctor`, or explicit
  host-side diagnostic queries to inspect grant-file health.
- `createAdmissionCatalog` is no longer exported from `./plugin-host`; use
  `ctx.tuiPluginHost.selfCheck()` and `/doctor` for diagnostics.
- `ctx.tuiPluginHost.grants` is now the caller-safe `HostGrantFacade`:
  `grants.allows(pluginCtx, permission, scope)` derives the principal from the
  current activation and no longer accepts an arbitrary `GrantPrincipal`
  / full `GrantStore`.
- `GrantStore` and `GrantPrincipal` are no longer public plugin APIs; they
  remain internal host types in `src/adapter/standard/grants.ts`. Host-side
  embedders should use repository-internal paths rather than depending on
  these types from the public package.
- `@deepseek-harness-tui/dsh-tui/test-utils` has been removed; the
  repository-internal `scripts/lib/plugin-test-utils.ts` is only for this
  repo's headless verification and is not part of the public contract.
  Ecosystem plugin tests should reproduce the flow through normal admission
  in their own test environment.
- The reversible live-probe methods (`probeReversible` on storage/message
  services and `probeCommandReversible` on the host service) are no longer
  part of the plugin-visible service surface. They are host-only internals
  invoked through a guarded accessor; plugins should not call or rely on them.

### Known platform boundaries (not covered by the shadow gate)

The TUI shadow gate only covers seams owned by the TUI host. The following are
explicitly recorded platform boundaries and are not claimed as fully mediated:

- direct `ctx.get('commands').register` / `ctx.get('commands').execute` (C-070);
- `ctx.plugin()` / `candidate.plugin()` sub-plugin installation (Cordis platform);
- agent preset roster / recompose registration (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets`);
- system prompt section registration (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-system-prompt`);
- skill registry registration/invocation (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill`).

These are listed as `platform-known boundary` in `verify-adapter-shadow`.
In addition, `verify-adapter-shadow` explicitly records two known gate
boundaries: internal TUI state/view helper classes not listed in
`NON_SERVICE_POLICY`, and React UI state/event handlers under
`src/screens` / `src/components`. They are not adapter capability entry
points and are not claimed as covered by the shadow gate.


### Adapter live-probe honesty and P2 boundary

This round moves `Command` / `LocalStorage` / `MessageObserver` from
"staged without a real probe" to "live with reversible probes" (run asynchronously
in legacy/new modes), and adds a minimal `KernelRuntime` plus passive/replay
harness:

- **Command live probe**: temporarily registers a unique no-op command on the
  real commands service, verifies it through `find` / `list`, executes it once
  against an in-memory fake agent session, and unregisters in `finally`. It
  writes no durable DSH session log; the only transient observable is one
  in-process `commands/change` notification while the probe is registered.
- **LocalStorage live probe**: creates a random temporary namespace file in the
  real storage directory, performs write/read/delete, and removes the file in
  `finally`. It never touches a real plugin namespace and leaves no probe data.
- **MessageObserver live probe**: uses the broker's internal probe-only
  publication channel so the synthetic event is delivered only to the temporary
  probe subscription. Real plugin `session:*` wildcard subscribers receive zero
  probe messages, and the subscription count returns to the original value.
  These live-probe methods are not plugin-visible public service methods; the
  kernel reaches them only through an internal host-only accessor.
- **Default legacy compatibility publication**: `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_MODE` defaults
  to `legacy`; that mode does not load the new Kernel or run reversible live
  probes. It keeps the old publication semantics through a separate
  `buildLegacyHostDescriptor` path: as long as the existing Command /
  LocalStorage / MessageObserver service rows are mounted,
  `describe()` / `hostDescriptor()` publish those contracts for plugin
  admission. The build result explicitly labels this as a legacy compatibility
  declaration in warnings, separate from new-mode live-only descriptors.
- **Fail-closed mode configuration**: only an unset `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_MODE`
  defaults to `legacy`. Explicit values must be `legacy`, `passive-shadow`,
  `replay-shadow`, or `new` (case-insensitive, with surrounding whitespace
  ignored); empty or unknown values raise an error and refuse startup.
  Non-legacy compositions return an empty-contract descriptor while the Kernel
  is not ready, refresh is skipped/failed, or the Kernel is disposed; they never
  fall back to compatibility publication.
- **Host probe access boundary**: the `host-probe-access` token is a
  module-local non-exported symbol and the normal package `exports` map rejects
  deep imports. Because plugins and the host share a process, absolute-path
  loading of the compiled internal file cannot be blocked by `exports`; this is
  a **trusted-in-process boundary, not a security sandbox**, and the host does
  not claim “plugins cannot call it” unconditionally. The internal registration
  functions will not replace an already-bootstrapped host probe runner.
- **Passive Shadow**: deliberately does not run these reversible probes; it only
  performs read-only detect/descriptor snapshots. **Replay Shadow**: production
  replay does not connect to a real DSH host; use
  `scripts/verify-adapter-replay-harness.ts` or `src/adapter/kernel/replay.ts`
  with an isolated replay context. Otherwise it fails closed with an explicit
  message.
- Replay harness usage: run the gate with
  `node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-adapter-replay-harness.ts`, or call
  `runReplayShadow({ schemaVersion: 'tui-adapter-replay/v1', ... })` in code to
  get a comparison report containing `kernelContracts`, `legacyContracts`,
  `missing`, `extra`, and `lifecycles`. From P5 the harness also supports real
  DSH session snapshot/transcript replay through
  `runChannelReplay(...)` / `verify:adapter-channel-conformance`, following the
  `tui.dsh/v1alpha1#Channel` Provider/Consumer envelope and validators.
- The public Host Descriptor still publishes only live lifecycles carrying real
  probe evidence; before live refresh completes (or in passive/replay modes)
  `Command` / `LocalStorage` / `MessageObserver` remain staged/degraded and are
  not claimed as fully supported. `DecisionEvents` keeps its per-feature probe +
  real channel/dispatch topology publication rule.
- P6 removes the internal `admissionCompat` parallel view and deletes the
  `src/plugin-spec/*` and `src/dsh-adapter/{grants,host-descriptor}.ts` compat
  shims. Production code imports `src/adapter/standard/*` directly;
  `verify:compat-removal` now scans `src/`, `scripts/`, `bin/`, generated
  `lib/` (when present), and the package export graph;
  `verify:package` rejects old shims in the npm tarball. Retained compatibility
  aliases (`ExtensionGrants`, `envelopeSchema`, `createAdmissionCatalog`,
  `facadeFromLegacy`, etc.) are explicitly marked as outside P6 / long-term.
- The new kernel is no longer a P1 shell: `KernelRuntime` owns driver
  registration/mount, detection, `declared → staged → live`, cleanup, and a
  diagnostic snapshot. Production Host Descriptor, `getHostFacade()`, `/doctor`,
  and `/plugins` all use this runtime.
- **P3 feature-level live publication**: `Workspace` / `Scenes` / `Settings` /
  `Extensions` no longer pretend that “register + list + dispose” means the
  whole capability is live. Only methods actually verified by a read-only or
  reversible probe are promoted to live (for example `host.workspaces.list`,
  `host.workspaces.resolve`, `host.scenes.register`, `host.settings.register`,
  `host.status.set`, `host.command-trees.children`);
  `host.toast.show` remains degraded because the real production delivery path
  is not yet verified;
  unverified methods such as `rename`, `runCommand`, `commandShell`,
  `scenes.open`, `settings.subscribe`, shortcut dispatch, and command-tree
  descriptions stay degraded/staged. Interactive `presentation.ask` is bridged
  to the real `QuestionStore`; `presentation.approve` is explicitly staged in P3.
- **Production P3 slices are loaded**: non-`legacy` `TuiPluginHostRuntime` now
  passes `ADAPTER_KERNEL_SLICES` into the production `KernelRuntime`, so P3
  slices enter mount/refresh/descriptor flows. Missing host services degrade
  the corresponding slice instead of crashing. `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_SLICES` also
  filters kernel slices by slice id / capability / effect matrix instead of
  being a dead option.
- **Host-initialization runtime snapshot**: all adapter/host services
  (storage/message/plugin-host and the P3 status/workspaces/scenes/settings/
  toast/dialogs/command-trees/questions/approvals seams) capture an immutable
  `AdapterRuntimeOptions` snapshot at initialization. Changing
  `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_MODE` or `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_SLICES` later in the same process
  cannot unlock passive/replay services into `new`; capability entry points no
  longer read `process.env` on every call.
- **Slice ownership and boundaries**: `DSH_TUI_ADAPTER_SLICES` is now normalized
  for case/whitespace, accepts common aliases (for example `dialogs` →
  `presentation`, `decisions` → `decisions`), and rejects unknown slice ids
  fail-closed. `toast` is no longer implicitly loaded by `presentation`, and
  `decisions` is no longer implicitly loaded by `messages`.
- **P4 Channel Port/projection layer (honest wording)**: new
  `projection / actions / state / plugins / transcript` Host Ports and
  `src/adapter/channel/*` split modules, mounted as a `channel` KernelSlice and
  consumed by the production driver. The production
  `src/dsh-adapter/channel.ts` implementation itself is **not yet physically
  split**; it remains the live Channel implementation source. **T1 core
  migration is partial: production `plugin.ts` notifications/initial submit
  now prefer `HostFacade.channel.actions`; in non-shadow modes a not-yet-mounted
  facade can fall back to the native Channel, but passive/replay shadow never
  falls back (missing/denied calls are dropped); most remaining UI/Channel
  actions still call the native Channel directly.**
  HostFacade guards each method with the shadow policy, so passive/replay allows
  read-only projections while denying mutations.
- **P5 Channel Provider/Consumer**: new local Provider/Consumer implement the
  `tui.dsh/v1alpha1#Channel` open/subscribe/invoke/close envelope and validation.
  `runChannelReplay` accepts recorded snapshot arrays and also projects real
  DSH `agent.session.events`-shaped records into monotonic
  `TuiChannelSnapshot`s. This is explicitly a **minimal transcript replay**:
  it covers transcript/status/basic session fields and, when metadata is
  supplied, carries RFC-adjacent fields such as model/mode/preset/settings/scene/
  diagnostic/trace/context/pending/usage; it still does **not** claim full
  RFC 0007 Channel state/conformance. Unknown methods fail per protocol,
  features must be explicitly declared and each must have observable
  state/method evidence, duplicate features are rejected first, unknown
  non-ignorable DSH events fail closed, method handlers only run inside replay
  isolation, and the replay provider explicitly does not resolve
  workspace/sessionId selectors. Continuity violations fail closed.
- **P3 feature lifecycle stability**: after `refresh`, subsequent
  `mount()` / `descriptorBuild()` / `diagnosticSnapshot()` calls that rerun
  synchronous `detect()` do not clear the probed P3 features. These features are
  internal Kernel/Port facts and are not entered into the public Host
  Descriptor.
- **Settings section live honesty**: `host.settings.section` is live only when
  the probe actually calls `section()` to resolve the temporary namespace;
  missing/failed resolution degrades the feature instead of claiming live from
  register/list alone.
- **Per-method Host Port shadow guards**: every Port method returned by
  `KernelRuntime.facade()` runs the unified effect-class check first. In
  passive/replay production modes, `rename`, `runCommand`, `commandShell`,
  `scenes.open`, `settings.subscribe`, and register-class methods are denied;
  read-only methods remain available for diagnostics.
- **Toast live probe** uses an independent probe-only sink pipeline and never
  replaces or swallows concurrent production toasts. **Status live probe**
  degrades when `clearIf` fails or leaves residue, rather than claiming live.
- `verify:adapter-slices` / `verify:adapter-detection` now also assert that the
  production plugin-host actually passes `ADAPTER_KERNEL_SLICES`, preventing a
  gate that only tests a directly constructed `KernelRuntime`.

The core repository remains independent; community plugins live in their own
repos. The organization only maintains the listing and admission rules — it
does not endorse or warrant the functionality, quality, or safety of community
plugins. Plugin authors keep full ownership of their repositories and are
responsible for their maintenance and security.

## Permissions and Security Boundary

> **Windows security warning:** The Windows profile defaults to `danger-full-access` with approval set to `never`. Tools therefore have unrestricted access; before starting in an environment with sensitive credentials or an untrusted repository, inspect and tighten the profile configuration.

`dsh-TUI` does not implement a separate sandbox. It uses the filesystem,
shell, sandbox, and approval policies of the active DSH profile. Permission
presets come from the mounted DSH `permissionPresets` registry: third-party
presets appear automatically in the picker, completion and the `Shift+Tab`
cycle (excluding `custom`/`status`, canonical presets, duplicate identities
and unsafe tokens), with the registry's declaration order kept stable across
refreshes. `custom` is a current-state label only, never a selectable target.
While the service snapshot is usable, `/permission` is surfaced as a first-class
local command: switches prefer the official `/permission <preset>` command; when
the command row never reaches the agent's registry, the TUI falls back to the
permissionPresets service's own official write path (the same handler the
command drives — real `permission/preset`/`sandbox/mode`/`approval/policy`
events, never fabricated by the TUI) and confirms via event/readback; when
neither path exists it fails loudly instead of silently falling through.
Exiting plan mode restores the pre-plan atoms first, then returns the durable
identity to the preset you were on before plan mode (while the registry still
offers it).
When the `permissionPresets` service is absent, TUI keeps its legacy three-row
compatibility roster. A mounted but unusable service is marked unavailable and
fails closed instead of inventing a roster. Inspect
the profile before starting it around sensitive credentials or an untrusted
repository.
